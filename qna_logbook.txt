Introduction to the Internet: The internet is like a vast network of connected computers around the world. It's the foundation of the World Wide Web (WWW) and enables us to share information, communicate, and access resources online.

History of the Internet: The internet's beginnings can be traced back to the 1960s, and it was initially developed for military and academic purposes. Over time, it evolved into a global communication tool.

Internet Design Principles: The internet operates based on specific design principles that ensure its reliability and scalability. These principles include open standards, decentralization, and robustness.

Internet Protocols: Protocols are rules that govern how data is transmitted over the internet. Some common ones include FTP (File Transfer Protocol), TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and Telnet. They enable different computers to communicate effectively.

Client-Server Communication: In many online interactions, one computer (the client) requests information or services from another computer (the server). This client-server model is fundamental to how the internet works.

Web System Architecture: The World Wide Web has a specific architecture that includes components like web browsers, web servers, and databases. It's organized in a way that allows users to access web content seamlessly.

World Wide Web (WWW): The WWW is a system of interconnected webpages and resources accessible through the internet. It has gone through various stages of evolution and involves different technologies and standards.

Web Architectures: Web architectures refer to the organization and structure of websites and web applications. They can be static (unchanging) or dynamic (changing based on user input).

Web Clients and Servers: Web clients (typically web browsers) request and display web content, while web servers store and deliver that content to clients when requested.

Static and Dynamic Web Applications: Some websites are static, meaning their content doesn't change frequently. Others are dynamic, with content that can change based on user actions or database updates.

Front-end and Back-end Web Development: Front-end development involves designing the visible part of a website that users interact with. Back-end development deals with the behind-the-scenes functionality, like databases and server operations.

HTML, CSS, JS, XML: These are essential technologies for web development. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) structures web content, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles it, JS (JavaScript) adds interactivity, and XML (Extensible Markup Language) is used for data storage and exchange.

HTTP and Secure HTTP (HTTPS): HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for transferring web data. HTTPS adds a layer of security (SSL/TLS) to protect data during transmission.

URL (Uniform Resource Locator): A URL is a web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet. It's what you type into your browser's address bar.

Web Services – SOAP, REST: These are two different approaches to building web services that allow different systems to communicate over the internet. SOAP uses XML, while REST is more lightweight and often relies on simpler data formats like JSON.

Module 2: HTML and CSS

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is the language used to create web pages. It uses tags and elements to structure content.

HTML Document Structure: An HTML document has a specific structure, including the head (metadata) and body (content) sections.

HTML Editors: HTML can be written in any text editor, but there are specialized HTML editors that make it easier to create web pages.

HTML Tags and Attributes: HTML tags are used to define elements on a web page, and attributes provide additional information about those elements.

Designing Simple Pages: You can create a basic web page by using HTML tags to structure content and add links, images, tables, lists, and more.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style and format web pages. It allows you to control fonts, colors, layouts, and other visual aspects of your web content.

CSS Syntax and Selectors: CSS rules are written with a specific syntax, and selectors are used to target HTML elements for styling.

Embedding CSS: You can include CSS styles directly within an HTML document or link to external CSS files.

Formatting Fonts, Text, and Backgrounds: CSS gives you the power to control the appearance of text, including fonts, sizes, colors, and background colors.

Inline Styles: You can apply CSS styles directly to individual HTML elements using inline styles.

External and Internal Style Sheets: CSS can be placed in external files that are linked to multiple HTML pages (external style sheets) or included directly within HTML documents (internal style sheets).

Borders and Boxing: CSS can be used to add borders and create boxes around elements on a web page.

Module 3: XML and HTML5, CSS3

XML (Extensible Markup Language): XML is a language for storing and sharing structured data. It uses tags similar to HTML but doesn't have predefined tags for specific content types.

Difference between HTML and XML: HTML is used for web content, while XML is more general-purpose and used for data representation and exchange.

XML Editors: Specialized XML editors help create and manage XML documents.

XML Elements and Attributes: Like HTML, XML uses elements and attributes to structure and describe data.

XML DTD and XML Schema: These are tools for defining the structure and rules of XML documents to ensure data consistency and validity.

XML Parser: An XML parser reads XML documents and converts them into usable data structures.

Document Object Model (DOM): DOM represents the structure of an XML or HTML document as a tree, allowing programs to access and manipulate it.

HTML5: HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, offering new features and capabilities for web development.

CSS3: CSS3 is an updated version of CSS, with additional styling options and effects.
